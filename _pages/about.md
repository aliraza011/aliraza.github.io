I am interested in building intelligence infrastructure to enable collaborative machine learning, and more generally in the generation, usage, and governance of data. My work attempts to use theory as a guide to building systems that work in the real world. So far, it has involved topics such as federated learning, decentralized learning, explainable AI, robustness, security, and privacy.
The true potential of machine learning can only be unleashed when it is trustworthy and responsible. Carefully building, designing, and understanding complex behavior of machine learning systems to avoid any unintended bias, security, and privacy concerns is, I believe, one of the most pressing problems we currently face.
